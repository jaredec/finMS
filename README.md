Hello, this is a compilation of some programming projects I have completed during my time at UC Santa Barbara. Here is a description of each folder name (ordered by descending completed date):

Mathematical Finance (Fall 2022)
- This folder contains all programming portions of assignments for this course using R.
- In addition there is a csv file (AAPL.csv) utilizing the black scholes model for constructing a delta neutral portfolio of the stock AAPL's log returns--you may need to scroll to the right when viewing. 
- This course describes mathematical methods for estimating and evaluating asset pricing models, equilibrium and derivative pricing, options, bonds, and the term-structure of interest rates. Also introduces finance optimization models for risk management and financial engineering.

Regression Analysis (Fall 2022)
- These assignments demonstrate my data visualization, statistical programming, and data/statistical analysis skills in R.
- Topics include linear and multiple regression, analysis of residuals, transformations, variable and model selection including stepwise regression, and analysis of covariance. This course stresses the use of computer packages to solve real-world problems.

Numerical Analysis A, B, & C (Winter 2022, Spring 2022 & Summer 2022)
- This folder contains all the programming assignments I have completed. I used Jupyter Notebook to record and display my solutions in Markdown or Python to each homework question. The common Python libraries I used were numpy, matplotlib and math.
- This course emphasizes the applications of numerical differentiation and integration, initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations, direct methods for solving linear systems, and iterative techniques in matrix algebra. Moreover, the course involves error analysis, solutions of equations in one variable, interpolation and polynomial approximation.

Applied Stochastic Processes A & B (Spring & Summer 2022)
- This folder contains all the homework assignments I have completed for the first half of this course. I used Jupyter Notebook to program Python functions/computations relating to discrete and continous stochastic processes. 
- Topics include discrete probability models and simulation techniques for random variables. Discrete time stochastic processes: random walks and Markov chains with applications to Monte Carlo simulation and mathematical finance. While there were not programming assignments for the second part of this course, we focused on continuous time stochastic processes: Poisson process, Markov chains, Renewal process, Brownian motion, including simulation of these processes. Applications to Black-Scholes model, insurance and ruin problems and related topics. 

SAS Base Programming (Winter 2022)
- This folder contains homework assignments I have completed for this course, using SAS Studio.
- In depth SAS programming course. Topics include importing/exporting raw data files, manipulating/transforming data, combining SAS data sets, generating reports, handling syntax and logic errors.

Principles of Data Science with R (Winter 2021) 
- While I no longer have material for this course, topics include: descriptive statistics, distributions and graphics in R. Relational database management systems including the relational model, relational algebra, database design principles and data manipulation using SQL. An introduction to the concept of big data.
